Salutations to the guru parampara - narayana to brahma to vasishta … sri  
Shankaracharya…, his disciples padmapada, hastamalaka, totaka and the  
followers of this lineage of gurus.

Prostrations again and again at the feet of bhagavan Shankara, the  
storehouse of scriptures - shruti, smriti and puranas - and who is also  
a storehouse of compassion, who confers happiness and prosperity, who  
has written commentary on the sutras and belongs in the lineage of the  
guru parampara of keshava, badarayana ..

First, having offered the traditional salutations to the Guru Parampara  
(lineage of teachers), let us chant the following shanti mantra;

Om saha nA-vavatu, saha nou-bhunaktu, saha-vIryam karavAvahai  
tEjasvi nA-vadhItam astu mA vid-vishAvahai; Om shAntih shAntih shAntih

Let us be protected together; let us be cultivated together; let us gain  
strength and power together; let our study be successful; let us not  
hate each other; Om ॐ peace, Peace and Peace (for all).

The scriptures of sanatana dharma - called "darshana shastras" are  
nyaya, vaisheshika, samkhya, yoga, mimamsa and vedanta, respectively the  
sciences of Logic, Nature, Knowledge, Deep Meditation or concentration  
of mind, Rituals of the veda and the Philosophy of the Self. Though  
Vaisheshika is regarded as the study of nature, nature is integral in  
the study of all the six Darshanas. A self evident thought common for  
all of them is "The whole creation is ultimately intended for the  
experience of the soul (Atman)".

We are concerned here in the study of vEdAnta - the Science of the Self.  
We have already said that nature is integral in the study of all  
shAstras, including vEdAnta. The nature and the body of beings are  
inert; The vEdAnta shAstra tells us that being inert, a power is  
required to drive them (Physical science also tells us that inert bodies  
need an external force for change - Newton&#39;s first law of motion).  
vEdAnta calls this power as "Chaitanya" or Consciousness. <span class="caps">D.V.</span> Gundappa,  
a poet-philosopher from Karnataka, India, captures the concept in a very  
subtle way in his work "Manku Timmana Kagga" (The ramblings of Timma,  
the Dull) as follows.

jIva jaDa rUpa prapanchavana-vAvudO  
AvarisikonDu moLaneredu mihudante  
bhAvakoLapaDadante aLategaLavaDadante  
A vishEshake maNiyO - mankutimma

An indefinable something envelops the living world  
and the inert and appears to fill them to overflowing  
It is not swayed by feeling and defies measurement  
Render obeisance to that specialty - Oh! Manku Timma (Timma the Dull)

This indefinable something - of the nature of Pure Consciousness - is called  
Brahman in vEdAnta.

So we have three entities here, Jagat or universe, individual person or jIva  
and Brahman. The first two are in the tangible experience of all of us. The  
third, Brahman is not the tangible experience for most of us.

Every philosophy that man knows today, attempts to describe the relation  
between these three entities.

Advaita vEdAnta also offers a very unique description of this  
relationship - the jIva and Jagat are not different from Brahman, but  
appear to be different because of ignorance ( ajnyAna). The presentation  
of this oneness of the three entities of Jagat, Jiva and Brahman is the  
subject matter of the study of Advaita vEdAnta. Again, quoting from  
Manku Timmana Kagga,

ihudO illavO tiLiyagoDadondu vastu nija mahimeyim jagavAgi jIvavEshadali  
viharipudau oLitembudu gahana tatvake sharaNO - mankutimma

An entity whether existing or not is not to be known  
But by its innate power it transmutes itself into the world;  
Assuming the garb of life it sports itself; whether it is, or not is not, we know not,  
Bow down to that profound principle - Oh! Manku Timma

What is the benefit of this study? This is a question we all want to  
have answered, as we undertake to the study of any text or Thesis. There  
are four issues contained in answering this question. They are (1)  
subject matter, (2) benefit, (3) Relationship and (4) Pre-requisites.

Determination of the oneness of Jiva, Jagat and Iswara (a synonym for  
Brahman) through scriptural interpretation is the subject matter of this  
study.

The benefit of this study is the preparation of the reader in the quest  
towards the realization of the oneness described above. This realization  
will release the Jiva from the cycle of births and deaths and the  
associated pain and occasional pleasure. The realization will elevate  
the jIva to a permanent state of absolute bliss. The TaittirIya  
Upanishat offers a measure of quantification of this bliss. If a strong  
and healthy human, living for hundred years or more, has all the  
resources under his control and the support of all the people under him,  
achieves all his objectives (YudhishTira is quoted as an example of such  
a person), the happiness attained by him is one Unit of Human Happiness  
(AshiShTO driDiShTO baliShTah..sa EkO mAnuSha Anandah... - Anandavalli).  
The bliss of realization is indicated to be of the order of 10<sup>20</sup> x  
Human Happiness.

The relationship of any study is at three levels - between the subject  
matter and the reader, between the subject matter and benefit and  
between reader and the benefit.  Application to the vEdAnta study, we  
will understand the relation between jIva and Jagat, jIva and Brahman  
and Brahman and Jagat.

What is the AdhikAra or pre-requisites for the realization? The  
necessary and sufficient pre-requisites for the realization of this  
oneness is a four step discipline (sAdhana chatushTaya), which will  
discuss in detail in the next unit.

Now a question arises to all of us - If the realization is so blissful,  
why is the mankind not serious about achieving it. Arjuna also had the  
same doubt, when he asked Krishna in Bhagavad gIta the following;

Atha kEna prayuktOyam pApam charati pUrushah  
ani-cchannapi vArshnEya balAdiva niyojitah

Oh! Krishna, as if constrained by a force, what makes a man commit sin,  
even against his wish? - (3-36)

Sri Krishna answers;

kAma Esha krOdha Esha rajO guNa samudbhavah  
mahAshanO mahApApma viddhi Enam iha vairiNam

Arjuna! it is the desire, it is the anger born of raJo guNa (the impulse  
of action), all consuming and all evil; know this as the enemy here. - (3-37)

Driven by these desires and feelings, we act. When the outcome is less  
than optimal, we repent -

kimakhagam sAdhu nAkaravam  
kimaham pApamakaravamiti

why did I not do good deeds  
why did I do bad deeds?  
- taittirIya upanishad, Anandavalli

Elimination of this desire and anger is the pre-requisite  
(sAdhanachatushTaya) discussed above. This will be the topic of  
discussion in the next unit.
